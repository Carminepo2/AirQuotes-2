# AirQuotes-2

AirQuotes is a project that our team developed during the Apple Developer Academy.<br />
Our goal was to help people keep track of their favourite quotes from any media.<br />
The application allows the user to organize the quotes in different ways and offers a wide range of customization.<br />
The application facilitates the fruition and retrieval of quotes thanks to attractive graphics and an innovative tagging system.<br />
